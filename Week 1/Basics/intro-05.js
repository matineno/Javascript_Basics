Strict mode

JavaScript JavaScript was designed to be easy for novice programmers to use. For that 
reason, JavaScript differs from some other programming languages, such as 
Java, which demand strict applications ot rules for syntax and program
structure. Some JavaScript lapses in syntax are resolved in a away that it
is not fatal to the program's execution. While this is attracted to novice
programmers, it does encourage a certain degree of laxness in coding.
Many developers advocate that JavaScript be run-time errors. Using strict mode
encourages good programming technique and also make the script run more 
effectively and faster. To run a script mode, add the following
statement to the first line.

When strict mode is engaged, a mistake that would normally be ignored 
now generates an error. What kind of mistake?

- Typrs in variable names in assignment throw an error
- Assignments that would normally fall quietly now throws an error
