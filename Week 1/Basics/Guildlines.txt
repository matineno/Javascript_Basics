Guildlines and best practices for JavaScript

** READ  THIS BEFORE STARTING A PROJECT **

- In a web project, name your 'js' file 'app' or 'index'
- Your code must be clean, organised and readable
- Add 'use strict' to all your 'js' files 
- Use the proper naming xconvention when creating files, variables, constants,
  objests, arrays and functions
- Don't use 'var'. Use 'let' and 'const'
- Use variables instead of hard-coded values
- Don't you dare use 'if (true)' or 'while (true)' 
- Don't compaire a Boolean to true/false. The value is already a Boolean
- Use === instead of ==
- Avoid truthy and falsy conditions. Use clear conditions
- Avoid long sequence of 'if' and nested 'if'
- Keep your functions short. One function should do one job.
- If you are hard-coding alot of valuest or repeating data, you are probably 
  (95%) doing something wrong 
- "More we know the language our tools, less we code." Andre Specht
- Don't use obstrusive (aka inline)
